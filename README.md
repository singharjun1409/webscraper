# Webscraper

I built a web scraper using Python and the Selenium module to automate the extraction of financial analysis data for publicly traded company stocks. By simulating browser actions, the scraper navigates through financial websites such as Yahoo Finance.

â€‹The scraped data is stored in structured formats like CSV or JSON for further analysis. This tool demonstrates the integration of web automation with data collection for financial insights.

## Run
run the program by double clicking the main executable file in dist folder
