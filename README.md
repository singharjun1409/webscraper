# Webscraper

This web scraper is built using Python and the Selenium module to automate the extraction of financial analysis data for publicly traded company stocks. By simulating browser actions, the scraper navigates through financial websites such as Yahoo Finance and collects key information like price history, P/E ratios and volume traded. Selenium handles dynamic content and JavaScript-rendered pages effectively, ensuring accurate and real-time data retrieval. The scraped data is stored in structured formats like CSV or JSON for further analysis. This tool demonstrates the integration of web automation with data collection for financial insights.
